# Python_Keylogger
A simple Keylogger made in python.

# What is a Keylogger
Keyloggers, or keystroke loggers, are tools that record what a person types on a device. While there are legitimate and legal uses for keyloggers, many uses for keyloggers are malicious. In a keylogger attack, the keylogger software records every keystroke on the victim's device and sends it to the attacker.

You can combine it with python Attacking Pendrive tool in my other repository to automatically launch it on target PC.
